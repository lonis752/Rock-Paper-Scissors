This project uses JS to write code that creates a playable rock, paper, scissors game that you can play against the computer.
Starting by creating code to get the computer to output a random selection of one of the three values of rock, paper, or scissors.
Then providing a prompt so that the human users can input their desired answer of rock, paper or scissors.
Lastly create a round system so that one could play an entire match with the compter in rock, paper, scissors.
